#Custom CMS Admin Theme

This is a Custom CMS Theme Website to show my knowledge of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript. The edit button only works for the Posts and Pages webpages and also the 'Create Content' dropdown only works for the Pages, Posts and Users webpages, it does not work for the Dashboard. You can also navigate through the dashboard menu on the left. Fontawesome was used for the icons on the webpages and it used through a CDN link so it doesn't load without internet connection. The 'logout' button works and also you must fill the input fields to login.
